## DRF EasyView

The Django DRF Package is a convenient package designed to simplify the integration of Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF). It provides tools and utilities that automate common tasks, such as model registration and generation of serializers and viewsets, and setup of URL patterns for API endpoints.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use `pip`:

    pip install drf-easyview==2.0.2

## Usage

To use the package in your Django project, follow these steps:

1. Add `drf_easyview` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's settings file.
2. Include the package's URLs in your project's `urls.py` file:

    ```python
    from django.urls import include, path
   
    urlpatterns = [
        # Other URL patterns
        path('easyview/', include('drf_easyview.urls')),
    ]
    ```

3. Start the server and check the root endpoint to have all your models APIs generated for you.

## Usage
Once models are created, you can add this package to your Django project to automatically create an OpenAPI for all your models. With the reference provided by the package, you can start creating custom API views based on your business or personal requirements.

Here's how you can use the package to create your custom API views:

1. Ensure that the Django DRF Package is installed and added to your project as explained in the installation steps.

2. Start the development server by running the following command:

        python manage.py runserver

3. Access the OpenAPI documentation for your models by appending `/easyview/` to the base URL of your Django project. For example, if your project is running at `http://localhost:8000/`, the OpenAPI documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/easyview/`.

4. Explore the available models and their corresponding endpoints in the OpenAPI documentation. This will provide you with the necessary information to create your custom API views.

5. Based on your requirements, you can create custom API views using Django Rest Framework's class-based views or function-based views. Refer to the Django Rest Framework documentation for detailed instructions on creating custom API views.


### Database Migration
Before using the package, run the database migration command to create the necessary tables:

    
    python manage.py migrate
    

### Starting the Server
To start the development server and access the APIs provided by your models, use the following command:

    
    python manage.py runserver
    

### Accessing the APIs
Once the server is running, you can access the APIs for your models by appending `/easyview/` to the base URL of your Django project.

For example, if your Django project is running at `http://localhost:8000/`, you can access the APIs for your models at `http://localhost:8000/easyview/`. The root of the API will provide a list of available models and their corresponding endpoints.

Please note that you should replace `http://localhost:8000/` with the actual base URL of your Django project.
